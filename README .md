# Hotel Data Analysis

Develop a database to analyze and visualize hotel booking data and present these visualizations to stakeholders.




## Objective

1] Is our hotel revenue growing per year?
   We have two hotel types so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type.


2] Should we increase our parking lot size? We want to understand if there is a trend  in guests with personal cars.


3] What trends can we see in the data? Focus on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality.
## Project Pipeline

1] Build a database.

2] Develop the SQL query.

3] Connect PowerBI to the database.

4] Visualize the sorted data.

5] Summarize findings.
